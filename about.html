                   I'm Phillip, an undergraduate college student and amateur programmer. The bulk of my programming-related work 
                   consisted of coding robots, but more recently I have moved on to new areas of development (like this HTML website!).

                    I feel most comfortable doing object-oriented programming. As stated before, the bulk
                    of my work involved programming machines in java. Some non-programming 
                    applications I use are Unity for game development, and I previously dabbled in 
                    blender (although I know very little). In the future 
                    I would like to learn and regularly work with HTML5, SQL, and Javascript.
