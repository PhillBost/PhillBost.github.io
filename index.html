                                    "Pharaoh" is a tele-operated as well as autonomously controlled robot programmed in Java. 
                                    The robot competed in the 2020 FIRST robotics competition in which it ranked 22 in the state of Michigan
                                    before the season was canceled due to Covid-19. The robot's design includes an automated intake system
                                    using various sensors, as well as PID controlled shooting. My, as well as my fellow team members' contributions 
                                    to the programming of the robot can be viewed at this github link.

                                    "Swerve-2021" is an updated version of the robot "Sidestep" which was built and
                                    programmed in 2016. The robot utilizes a "swerve" drivetrain which features
                                    four wheels whose headings and speeds are controlled independently using
                                    various encoders (kind of like a motorized shopping cart). I contributed 
                                    to the project during the off-season with other members of the 2020-21 software team.
                                    The project proved as a fun and challenging way to gain a better understanding of
                                    software engineering.

                                        One of my only Unity projects in C# on github is a few scripts that
                                        allow the user to control a physics object in a 3D space with a 3D 
                                        camera. I programmed it intending to use it on future projects.
                                        The template also includes camera collision, jumping, and sprinting.
                                        The project was primarily to support clean camera movement using the mouse
                                        that allows the player to zoom in and out. The design itself is very simple.
