                <p>I'm currently an undecided freshmen university student
                    with plans to study Computer Science or Cybersecurity.
                    I've been learning programming for five years now. I've 
                    applied programming to robotics, game design, simulation,
                    app design, and web development. I am a former member of
                    FIRST(For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) 
                    robotics team #548, of which I worked on a variety of 
                    machines and projects. My goal as a programmer is to be able to 
                    master a variety of mediums so that I can solve any problem that
                    comes to my mind.

                    Below is a proficiency chart demonstrating where I believe
                    my current skill levels belong. 1 star being just in-class 
                    experience, 6 stars being complete mastery.

                                "Pharaoh" is a tele-operated as well as autonomously controlled robot programmed in Java. 
                                The robot competed in the 2020 FIRST robotics competition in which it ranked 22 in the state of Michigan
                                before the season was canceled due to Covid-19. The robot's design includes an automated intake system
                                using various sensors, as well as PID controlled shooting. My, as well as my fellow team members' contributions 
                                to the programming of the robot can be viewed at this github link.

                                "Swerve-2021" is an updated version of the robot "Sidestep" which was built and
                                programmed in 2016. The robot utilizes a "swerve" drivetrain which features
                                four wheels whose headings and speeds are controlled independently using
                                various encoders (kind of like a motorized shopping cart). I contributed 
                                to the project during the off-season with other members of the 2020-21 software team.
                                The project proved as a fun and challenging way to gain a better understanding of
                                software engineering.

                                This Unity C# project consists of a few scripts that
                                allow the user to control a physics object in a 3D space with a 3D 
                                camera. I programmed the script intending to use it on future projects.
                                The template also includes camera collision, jumping, and sprinting.
                                The project was primarily to support clean camera movement using the mouse
                                that allows the player to zoom in and out. The design itself is very simple.

                    on sensory analysis, a tendency to think logically as opposed to
                    emotionally, and a tendency to act based on my perceived situation
                    as opposed to planning said situation extensively beforehand. (image from

                                    My first exploration activity was a brochure detailing the Cybersecurity major at Purdue University.
                                    The brochure was meant to be an easy way for other students to understand what cybersecurity was and how
                                    it is taught at Purdue. The brochure contains a brief snapshot of the plan of study, as well as some fun facts
